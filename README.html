<h1>Welcome to FLTrator - a FLTK retro arcade game!</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>FLTrator</strong> is a <em>VERY</em> retro style game in which you steer a spaceship through a scrolling
landscape with hostile rockets and other obstacles.</p>

<p>It is loosely inspired by a game called 'Penetrator', which was an arcade game from 1983(!)
on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. (I always found it a nearly perfect made game both from a
technical and playabilty point of view, considering it had to fit in only 48k of ram).</p>

<p>That's also the reason for the name: it is written using <strong>FLTK</strong> - the
<strong>F</strong>ast-<strong>L</strong>ight-<strong>T</strong>oolkit, so <strong>FLT</strong> + Pene<strong>trator</strong> => <strong>FLTrator</strong>.</p>

<p>To be honest, I started out only to make a tiny experiment if something like that
could possibly be done with nothing else but FLTK. But as the first results were
positive, I got hooked and tried to make something playable out of it.</p>

<p>But of course it could be endlessly improved and expanded,... which I think will likely
not happen ever.</p>

<p>What's become of it now is: <strong>10 different levels</strong> of play - no mission or things like that -
the goal beeing only to end level 10.</p>

<p>Levels can be edited with a supplied level editor though! So you can create other, perhaps
more exciting levels, than the ones defined by me.</p>

<h2>The game</h2>

<p>You control a spaceship with the keyboard that is moving over a right to left scrolling
terrain. But the terrain is changing fast and there are some enimies in it, that won't
let you pass so easy...</p>

<p>Touching any part of the landscape with the ship is always deadly. Touching objects mostly.</p>

<p>The first aspect of the game is the landscape. Landscapes have a ground level and
optionally a "sky" (or ceiling). This offers some ways to make them "interesting" 
by creating steep hills, tight gaps or tunnels,..</p>

<p>The other part are the objects, that can be put into the landscape:</p>

<h3>Rockets</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can be shot at with missiles and bombs.</li>
<li>Always destroy ship at collision.</li>
<li>Get more dangerous with each level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Radars</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are not particularly dangerous, but are obstacles and score well.</li>
<li>Can be shot at with missiles (but need 3 hits!) and bombs.</li>
<li>Always destroy ship at collision.</li>
<li>Trigger rocket launch if not destroyed early.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drops</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are nasty.</li>
<li>Can be "evaporated" with missiles.</li>
<li>Only destroy ship when they hit it fully, otherwise do no harm, and are just deflected.</li>
<li>Get more dangerous with each level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Badies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are also nasty as they block the way.</li>
<li>Can be attacked with missiles, but it needs up to 5 hits to succeed.</li>
<li>Are always deadly when touched.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phasers</h3>

<ul>
<li>Emit deadly vertical beams at random intervals (hint: they turn red when fully charged).</li>
<li>Can be destroyed with missiles and bombs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clouds</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do no harm, except that the ship gets invisible when passing through.</li>
<li>Can not be destroyed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of landscape and objects makes it possible to create some
challenging tracks.</p>

<p>And most important of course is the:</p>

<h3>Spaceship</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can fire missiles horizontally.</li>
<li>Can drop bombs vertically.</li>
<li>Can lag speed for some time, or speed up, which can be very usefull.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game is controlled by keyboard only, just like in the old days..</p>

<p>See all options with</p>

<p><code>fltrator --help</code> or find the navigation/control keys in the title menu.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The landscape editor</h2>

<p>You can edit any of the supplied landscapes or create new landscapes and
freely position objects in it.</p>

<p>See all options with</p>

<p><code>fltrator-landscape --help</code> or press <code>F1</code> key for help.</p>

<p>If you have created some interesting new landscapes I would be glad to see them!</p>

<h2>Resume</h2>

<p>Although I won't probably make huge changes to the game, if you have any easy to
implement ideas for improvement or find bugs, please report them to me.</p>

<p>Have fun with the game!</p>

<p><strong>Curious</strong>: Can you finish <em>all ten</em> levels?</p>

<h1>FLTrator runtime notes</h1>

<p>I developed this game on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit).</p>

<p>I have successfully tested and run a Mingw compiled version of the program
under Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>

<p>Under Linux the program was tested with various distros, also some older ones.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>

<p>According to the goal to use no external libraries, the program plays <code>.wav</code>
files by using the builtin play tool of the OS. This is <code>aplay</code> in case of Linux.</p>

<p>If you don't hear sound please make sure, that this program is installed
on your system and plays sounds from the command line.</p>

<p>Under Windows I wrote an interfacing program <code>playsound.exe</code>, that wraps the Windows
PlaySound() function. FLTrator calls this program to output sound.
It has to be in the path somewhere (or in the same path as fltrator).</p>

<p>You can add your own background sounds by putting them as <code>.wav</code> files into the <code>bgsound</code>
folder. From there they will be picked randomly. Or if you want a level to play a specific
sound put the file into the <code>wav</code> directory of this level (create the directory if needed)
under the name <code>bgsound.wav</code> e.g. <code>wav/3/bgsound.wav</code> for level 3.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Running fullscreen</h2>

<p>Running FLTrator in fullscreen on a big monitor is really a great pleasure!
It also runs faster and more smooth I believe.</p>

<p>So I dug out some instructions how to change resolution under Linux using Xrandr
and and also for Windows and integrated it everything into the program.</p>

<p>Use F10 to toggle fullscreen when in title menu or in paused state.</p>

<p>[Tested to work under Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, Windows 7]</p>

<hr />

<h2>Performance issues</h2>

<p>On older hardware or on a Windows system FLTrator's default framerate of 200 fps
may be too high.</p>

<p>You can change the frame rate in runtime:</p>

<p>On the <strong>title screen</strong> you see the current frame rate in the bottom/right corner.
Pressing '-' or '+' will change to the next value down or up.</p>

<p>Experiment with the values, until you get the best mix of performance vs  'jumpyness'.
Allowed values are 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 200. I recommend a rate 40+.</p>

<p>Of course lower values will decrease the smoothness of the scrolling.</p>

<p>If you found your best rate, you can put it in the command line:</p>

<pre><code>-Rfps  e.g. -R40
</code></pre>
