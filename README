Welcome to FLTrator!
====================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FLTrator is a *VERY* retro style game in which you steer a spaceship through a scrolling
landscape with hostile rockets and other obstacles.

It is loosely inspired by a game called 'Penetrator', which was an arcade game from 1983(!)
on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. (I always found it a nearly perfect made game both from a
technical and playabilty point of view, considering it had to fit in only 48k of ram).

That's also the reason for the name: it is written using FLTK - the
Fast-Light-Toolkit, so FLT + Penetrator => FLTrator.

To be honest, I started out only to make a tiny experiment if something like that
could possibly be done with nothing else but FLTK. But as the first results were
positive, I got hooked and tried to make something playable out of it.

But of course it could be endlessly improved and expanded,... which I think will likely
not happen ever.

What's become of it now is: 10 different levels of play - no mission or things like that -
the goal beeing only to end level 10.

Levels can be edited with a supplied level editor though! So you can create other, perhaps
more exciting levels, than the ones defined by me.


The game
~~~~~~~~

You control a spaceship with the keyboard that is moving over a right to left scrolling
terrain. But the terrain is changing fast and there are some enimies in it, that won't
let you pass so easy...

Touching any part of the landscape with the ship is always deadly. Touching objects mostly.

The first aspect of the game is the landscape. Landscapes have a ground level and
optionally a "sky" (or ceiling). This offers some ways to make them "interesting" 
by creating steep hills, tight gaps or tunnels,..

The other part are the objects, that can be put into the landscape:

Rockets
-------
   - Can be shot at with missiles and bombs.
   - Always destroy ship at collision.
   - Get more dangerous with each level.

Radars
------
   - Are not particularly dangerous, but are obstacles and score well.
   - Can be shot at with missiles (but need 3 hits!) and bombs.
   - Always destroy ship at collision.
   - Trigger rocket launch if not destroyed early.

Drops
-----
   - Are nasty.
   - Can be "evaporated" with missiles.
   - Only destroy ship when they hit it fully, otherwise do no harm, and are just deflected.
   - Get more dangerous with each level.

Badies
------
   - Are also nasty as they block the way.
   - Can be attacked with missiles, but it needs up to 5 hits to succeed.
   - Are always deadly when touched.

Clouds
------
   - Do no harm, except that the ship gets invisible when passing through.
   - Can not be destroyed.


The combination of landscape and objects makes it possible to create some
challenging tracks.

And most important of course is the:

Spaceship
---------
   - Can fire missiles horizontally.
   - Can drop bombs vertically.
   - Can lag speed for some time, or speed up, which can be very usefull.


The game is controlled by keyboard only, just like in the old days..


See all options with

  'fltrator --help' or find the navigation/control keys in the title menu.


The landscape editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can edit any of the supplied landscapes or create new landscapes.
See all options with

   'fltrator-landscape --help' or press F1 key for help.

If you have created some interesting new landscapes I would be glad to see them!

Although I won't probably make huge changes to the game, if you have any easy to
implement ideas for improvement or find bugs, please report them to me.


Have fun with the game!
Curious: Can you finish all ten levels?
